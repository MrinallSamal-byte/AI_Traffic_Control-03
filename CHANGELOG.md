## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Implementation Integration
1. **Apply input validation** to existing API endpoints
2. **Implement authentication middleware** with proper password hashing
3. **Add retry logic** with exponential backoff for external services
4. **Integrate Prometheus metrics** in all services
5. **Deploy to staging environment** using Terraform and Helm

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Real-time monitoring** with alerting
2. **Automated model retraining** pipeline
3. **A/B testing framework** for ML models
4. **Performance optimization** and caching strategies
5. **Multi-environment deployment** (dev/staging/prod)
