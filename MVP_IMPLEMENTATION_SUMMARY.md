# MVP Prototype Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. ML Model Training (`ml_services/train_model.py`)
- Generates 5k synthetic telemetry rows with realistic driving data
- Trains RandomForestRegressor with random_state=42 for reproducibility
- Features: speed, accel_x, accel_y, accel_z, jerk, yaw
- Risk target derived from speed and acceleration extremes
- Saves model to `ml_services/model.pkl` using joblib
- Prints Train/Test R² scores after training

### 2. Driver Scoring Service (`ml_services/driver_score.py`)
- `predict_score(telemetry: dict) -> dict` function
- Loads model.pkl if present, falls back to heuristic scoring
- Returns `{"score": float, "model": "random_forest"|"heuristic"}`
- Gracefully handles missing/bad fields with default values
- Score range: 0-100 (higher = more risky driving)

### 3. API Server (`api_server/app.py`)
- Flask server with CORS enabled
- `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok", "service":"api_server"}`
- `POST /driver_score` → Accepts telemetry JSON, returns driver score
- Input validation for required fields (device_id, timestamp)
- Proper error handling with 400/500 status codes
- Request logging for each driver score calculation

### 4. Device Simulator (`device_simulator/simulator.py`)
- Updated to POST telemetry to `http://localhost:5000/driver_score`
- CLI flags: `--devices`, `--interval`, `--api-url`
- Output format: `timestamp | device_id -> score=XX.XX model=...`
- Generates realistic telemetry with speed, acceleration, jerk, yaw
- Supports both single device and multi-device simulation

### 5. Dashboard (`dashboard/simple_demo.html`)
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JavaScript
- Real-time driver scores table with auto-refresh (1s)
- Statistics: active devices, average score, total scores, API status
- Color-coded risk levels (green/yellow/red)
- Works by opening file in browser or via local HTTP server
- Graceful fallback to demo data if API unavailable

### 6. Unit Tests (`tests/test_api_driver_score.py`)
- Tests for `/health` and `/driver_score` endpoints
- Validates response structure and data types
- Tests error handling (missing fields, invalid JSON)
- High-risk vs low-risk scenario validation
- Score range validation (0-100)
- Can run standalone or with pytest

### 7. Documentation (`README_QUICKSTART.md`)
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Expected output examples
- API endpoint documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
- Sample telemetry and response formats

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Script (`test_mvp_flow.py`)
- Validates ML service functionality
- Tests API server connectivity
- Verifies driver score endpoint
- Checks simulator telemetry generation
- Provides clear pass/fail results

12:34:57 | OBU-def456 -> score=23.45 model=random_forest
12:34:58 | OBU-ghi789 -> score=78.90 model=random_forest
```

### API Response
```json
{
  "device_id": "OBU-123",
  "timestamp": 1640995200,
  "driver_score": 45.67,
  "model": "random_forest"
}
```

## 🔧 Architecture

```
Device Simulator → HTTP POST → API Server → ML Service → Response
     ↓                           ↓
Dashboard ← HTTP GET ←────────────┘
```
